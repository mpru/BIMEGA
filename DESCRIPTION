Description: BIMEGA integrates methylation (MET) and gene expression (GE) data
    to identify genes regulated by hyper- or hypo-methylation. BIMEGA is based on
    a bivariate Gaussian mixture model to identify methylation states and compares
    them with the normal DNA methylation state. BIMEGA uses Differential Methylation
    value or DM-values, defined as the difference of a methylation state with the
    normal methylation state, to characterize each methylation state.
